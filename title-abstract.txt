Title:
Brain Region Activation From Sports Viewing

Abstract:
The goal of this report is to partially reproduce some of the ideas, analyses, and results from an original published paper, Antony et al., 2020. Through second-level analysis of 20 subjects, fMRI data that was used in the original paper was analyzed to determine if there is significant region activation during viewing and recall tasks.
